# Example

This is an example page showing how to use DocFX.

You can also auto-reference the API, e.g. <xref:Global.ButtonScript>.
To do so, write `<xref:Namespace.Class>`, so for the ButtonScript in the global namespace `<xref:Global.ButtonScript>`.
The title of the link is automatically determined.

The documentation is configured in a way that references to Unity's API are also resolved and linked: <xref:UnityEngine.Vector3>

... or references to Microsoft's API: <xref:System.String>
